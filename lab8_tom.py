Lab 8 - Set and Dict 
(100 marks in total, including 5 exercises - each 20 marks)

Author: Tom
Due Date: This Friday (Mar. 13) 5pm.
Note: Try best to finish the lab exercises using what we've learnt about algorithms.
      Please do not rely on AI assistant too heavily for labs.

Objective:
1. Review how to write a good python docstring (started from lab7).
2. Review how to code simple Python functions and write unit tests using assert.
3. Practice how to operate on set and dict.
4. Review iterations using loop.
5. Review the accumulator algorithm pattern (Initialize-Loop-Return):
   Initialize a variable that is assigned to an integer, a list, a string, a set, a dict, etc.; 
   Loop (for or while) to update the variable based on requirements; 
   Return the variable or a value related to this variable.

Here is one solution of Lab 7 exercise 3: Remove the duplicate characters in a string.
E.g.,
remove_duplicates("apple") == "aple"
remove_duplicates("Popsipple") == "Popsile" (Notice: 'P' and 'p' are different chars)
remove_duplicates("pear") == "pear"

Exercise 1 (20 marks: doctring: 5 marks, function implementation: 10 marks, unit tests: 5 marks)

Can you try to implement the above duplicates removal using data type set?

Hint: 1. We put the seen chars in the set while adding them to the res string;
      We also check if the new char is already in the set (more efficient than checking a string). If not seen, add it to the res string.
      2. To initialize an empty set: seen_set = set()

Exercise 2 (20 marks - doctring: 5 marks, function implementation: 10 marks, unit tests: 5 marks)

Assume you've collected many stones, 
and each character in the string stones represents a type of a stone. 
And each character in the string gems represents a type of a gem.

Write a function to calculate how many stones you've collected are actually jems. 
Requirement: Implement the function using data type set

E.g.,
gem_counting("abDFMdm", "admMQq") will return 4
gem_counting("abDFMdm", "af") will return 1
gem_counting("awCcM", "cQqW") will return 1
gem_counting("bFfL", "cQqW") will return 0

Exercise 3 (20 marks: doctring: 5 marks, function implementation: 10 marks, unit tests: 5 marks)

CapU is planning to launch a shuttle bus between main campus 
and the students accomendation. (Fake news but best wishes 😄)

To determine how many buses are needed each day, 
CapU keeps track of the students who use the shuttle bus service.

Write a function students_id() that takes a list of student ids as its parameter, 
and returns the number of different students who use the shuttle service.

E.g.,
students_id(['002', '003', '001', '004', '012']) returns 5
students_id(['002', '003', '001', '012', '003', '001']) returns 4

Hint: 
Think about which data type we should use to ease the work of finding distinctive values from a list.

Similar as exercise 3, write a function called students_id_occurences() 
that takes a list of student ids as its parameter, 
and returns the occurences of each different student 
who uses the shuttle service in the form of dictionary data type.

E.g.,
students_id_occurences(['002', '003', '001', '004', '012']) 
returns {'002': 1, '003': 1, '001': 1, '004': 1, '012': 1}}

Real-world Coding Question (optional): Extract Repository IDs and Names from GitHub API Data

The GitHub API allows you to search for repositories using different criteria. 
The following code sends a request to GitHub to find Python repositories with more than 300,000 stars.

The API response is converted into a Python dictionary called response_dict. 
Inside this dictionary, the key "items" contains a list of repository dictionaries,
where each repository includes information such as id, name, stars, and more.

Task: Write a function called id_name_repo_starred_300k(response_dict) that

You just need to upload this lab to your GitHub repository, and copy the link to e-learn. That's all.
